# Final Integrated Project Level 2

This repo is for FIP - Final Integrated Project - IDP Level 2

## Notes

Due to conflicts encountered with the existing code, which affected the actual behavior of the webpage rather than generating error codes, we have decided to separate the script for the "Add to Cart" functionality into a new file named custom.js. This approach ensures that our "Add to Cart" features operate independently and securely without impacting other functionalities.
